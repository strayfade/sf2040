### PCB Ordering Information
I personally ordered the PCBs pre-assembled from JLCPCB using their PCBA service. If you also decide to have the boards assembled, I have included the BOM (.csv) and the pick-and-place (.csv) files for JLCPCB to use during PCBA.

The board itself does not necessarily **require** any special specifications, but I chose to include the ENIG 1U" gold contact plating for *extra* good measure, just to ensure that neighboring contacts wouldn't be shorted around the RP2040 microcontroller.

All components on the board can be purchased and pre-assembled via the PCBA service except for the switch hot-swap sockets. These are easy enough to solder freehand and would have greatly added to the cost if included in the PCBA. I highly recommend buying them elsewhere and soldering them yourself. Purchase links are included in the top-level [README](/README.md).md
